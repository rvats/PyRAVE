# Rename Images with Date Photo Taken

# Purpose: Renames image files in a folder based on date photo taken from EXIF metadata

# Author: Rahul Vats Reference Support: Matthew Renze

# Usage: python.exe rename.py input-folder
#   - input-folder = (optional) the directory containing the image files to be renamed

# Examples: python.exe rename.py C:\Photos
#           python.exe rename.py

# Behavior:
#  - Given a photo named "RAV00001.jpg"  
#  - with EXIF date taken of "8/8/2024 5:54:17 PM"  
#  - when you run this script on its parent folder
#  - then it will be renamed "20180401-175417-001.jpg"
#  - To prevent rename conflict on multiple files taken at same time

# Notes:
#   - For safety, please make a backup of your photos before running this script
#   - Currently only designed to work with .jpg, .jpeg, and .png files
#   - If you omit the input folder, then the current working directory will be used instead.
